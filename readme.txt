DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

- Raw Data: Raw RNA sequencing data in fq.gz format.

- Scripts: Holds all scripts used to pre-process and quantify the data prior to differential gene expression analysis.

- Figures: Subdirectories hold scripts that were used to perform differential gene expression analysis using Sleuth, and subsequently generate the volcano plots, heatmaps provided in the publication.
